		こんにちは、ようこそ！ (That's Japanese for hello and welcome!)
	</p>
	<p>
		Welcome to Anime Sharing Hub™! I am Curtis Lane, the creator of this fine website. <br />
		I'm in Cohort 38, and am currently a second year.

		I chose to make this an anime social media site because:
		<ol>
			<li>
				I like anime.
			</li>
			<li>
				It was one of the examples in the assignment page, which leads nicely into the last reason,
			</li>
			<li>
				I am very bad at being creative, so I didn't want to try (and fail) to think of anything else.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		As a programmer, my current favorite languages would be C# and C++.
		<ul>
			<li>
				I like C#, because of how powerful, yet easy it is to use.
			</li>
			<li>
				And I like C++ because of how fast, and extremely powerful it is.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
